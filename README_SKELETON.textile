h1. Using Skeletion to generate a new Montage app

Skeletion is a command line script that allows you to quickly build out the default structure of a new Montage app.

To quickly build a new vanilla Montage app:

<pre>
$ php skeleton.php --path="path/to/put/app"
</pre>

To see all the options available to you:

<pre>
$ php skeleton.php --help
</pre>

h2. Customizing Skeletion

By using the option --include-path you can add paths that extend the default Skeletion classes, allowing you to customize the generator to fit your needs.

h2. Using Skeletion to quickly add new controllers, environments, plugins, etc.

Skeleton won't replace files so just add the appropriate option (e.g., --controller and --controller-class to add a new controller class) and the file will be generated and your current files won't be touched.
