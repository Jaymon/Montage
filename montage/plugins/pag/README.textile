h1. Pag

A tag parser for quickly finding certain tags in arbitrary html

h2. Getting Started

h3. Using Pag is easy, for example, to get all the a tags in $html:

<pre>
$pag = new pag($html);
$tag_list = $pag->get('a');
</pre>

h2. Notes

Pag uses regex to parse the html, I know, end of the world, you can't parse html with regex, it just simply isn't possible. For every chunk of html that can't be parsed with regex, I can find a chunk of html that can't be parsed with php's internal DOM parser. This works for me, it doesn't work on everything, but it works on what I've needed it to work on, and most importantly, it's worked when the DOM parser failed because I didn't specify the doctype right, or because there was an error in the syntax.

Also, because Pag lets you set the start and stop deliminators for the tags, you can use it to parse markup (eg, [tagname]body[/tagname]) and the like.
