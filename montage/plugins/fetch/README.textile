h1. Fetch

A wrapper for Curl in php that tries to take the monotony out of making a Curl request.

h2. Getting Started

h3. Making a fetch call is easy:

<pre>
$url = 'http://example.com';
$fetch = new fetch($url);
$fetch->setTimeout(5); // don't wait around forever
$fetch->setFields(array('foo' => 'bar')); // pass in as many vars as you want

$response = $fetch->get(); // $response is a fetch_response object instance
</pre>

h3. Want to save to a file instead?

<pre>
$url = 'http://example.com';
$save_path = join(DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR,array('.','example.txt'));

$fetch = new fetch($url);
$fetch->setPath($save_path);

$response = $fetch->get(); // $response is a fetch_response object instance
</pre>

h3. want to make your curl request in the background?

<pre>
$url = 'http://example.com';

$fetch = new fetch($url);

$fetch->start(); // start the request in the background

/* do other things here */

$response = $fetch->stop(); // get the response
</pre>

h3. Make an authenticated Post request

<pre>
$fetch = new fetch($url);
$fetch->setAuth($username,$password);
$fetch->setMethod(fetch::METHOD_POST);
</pre>

Fetch has tons of other options, check the code.
